# **Bomb Diffuser**

A simple web-based game where you defuse a bomb by entering the correct code before the timer runs out.

## **How It Works**
1. A 10-second countdown starts automatically.
2. Type `defuse` in the input box and press **Enter** to stop the timer.
3. If you enter the correct code in time, the message "You did it" appears.
4. If the timer reaches 0, the bomb "explodes" with the message "BOOM!!".

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the bomb interface.
- **JavaScript**: Timer and defusal logic.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## **File Overview**
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
- `index.css`: Styling for the application.
- `index.js`: JavaScript logic for the timer and defusal.
